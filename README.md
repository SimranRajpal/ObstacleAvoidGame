# ObstacleAvoidGame
Hello!
This is an Obstacle Avoid Game, fully made with graphics. If you want to run the game on your desktop, please open the project
in Android studio, and run DesktopLauncher. 
If you want to see how it looks, here's a video of it running on my laptop:

I made this game following a udemy course by Goran Lockhert.
The textures in the game are from the course and the music was found online.
Thanks for viewing my work, and enjoy the game!
