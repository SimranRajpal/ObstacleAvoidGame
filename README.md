# ObstacleAvoidGame
This is an Obstacle Avoid Game, fully made with graphics. If you want to run the game on your desktop, open the project
in Android studio, and run DesktopLauncher. 
I made this game following a udemy course by Goran Lockhert.
The textures in the game are from the course.
The music was found online.
Here is a video of the game running on my computer:
